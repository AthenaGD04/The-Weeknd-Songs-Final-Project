# The-Weeknd-Songs-Final-Project
This is my final project for my Social Statistics course where I analyzed the singer The Weeknd's songs. I looked at his top 30 songs and analyzed the number of streams, featured artists, and genre. I also looked at emotional tone and energy level of the songs.

## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "the_weeknd_songs_final_project_script.R," file, which contains the code from my findings. To access the data set, open the "sta215_didizian_rawdata.csv," file.

## **Data**
The data used for the analyses was gathered by looking at the top 30 songs of the singer and songwriter, The Weeknd. The question being asked was if the number of streams, featured artists, or genre were correlated with the emotional tone or energy level of the songs. Each unit of analysis was one song and 30 observations were collected. The type of sampling stratagy was ______ sampling.

I gathered the data by searching online The Weeknd's top 30 songs (as of February 18, 2024) in order to decipher whether or not there are correlations between the above variables. Finally, I checked Spotify for the amount of listeners each songs garners.

## **Operationalization**
The concept of the number of streams was operationalized by a variable named “streams”. Each song was measured by a qualitative coding scheme ranging from 0 - 4,073,653,677. Songs with fewer streams would fall lower on this scale, and vice-versa. To measure this concept, the number of streams was measured on the music platform Spotify.

The concept of the number of featured artists was operationalized by a variable named “featured artists”. Each song was measured by a qualitative coding scheme ranging from 1 - 3. A value of 1 describes the song as being performed by the main artist alone. A value of 2 describes the song as being performed by the main artist and one additional artist. A value of 3 describes the song as being performed by the main artist and three or more additional artists. To measure this concept, the number of featured artists was measured on the music platform Spotify.

The concept of the genre was operationalized by a qualitative variable named “genre”. Each song was measured by a qualitative coding scheme ranging from 1 - 5. A value of 1 describes the song as being in the Pop genre. A value of 2 describes the song as being in the R&B genre. A value of 3 describes the song as being in the Electronic genre. A value of 4 describes the song as being in the Alternative genre. A value of 5 describes the song as being in the Hip-hop/Rap genre. To measure this concept, the genre was recorded on the music platform Spotify. 

The concept of the perceived level of emotion in a song was operationalized by a quantitative variable called "emotional tone". Each song was measured using a qualitative coding scheme from 1 - 10. 1 describes the song as having a very sad tone, 5 having a neutral tone, and 10 having a very happy tone. To measure this concept, the meaning and lyrics were taken into consideration when operationalized. 

The concept of the perceived level of energy in a song was operationalized by a quantitative variable called "energy level". Each song was measured using a qualitative coding scheme from 1 - 10. 1 describes a song as being at a very low-energy level, 5 being at a neutral energy level, and 10 being at a very high energy level. To measure this concept, the meaning and lyrics were taken into consideration when operationalized.
